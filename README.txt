Using the aZero Timer:

The contents of the textboxes below "Hours:", "Minutes:" and "Seconds:" will determine the countdown of the timer.

The contents of the textbox "Alarm Repeats:" will determine the amount of times the alarm sound will play after the countdown is finished.

The big red "Start Timer" button will start the countdown.

If nothing (or non-integer numbers) is written in the "Hours:", "Minutes:" or/and "Seconds:" boxes will default to 0.

If nothing (or non-integer numbers) is written into the "Alarm Repeats:" box the alarm will only be repeated ONCE!

The "Alarm Selection" button enables you to select a file path to a wav-file. If you select a non-wav file it will use the default sound.
